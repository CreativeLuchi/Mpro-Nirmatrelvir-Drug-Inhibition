ðŸŽ¯ Step 1:  Sequence Analysis and Identification of Conserved Residues
Objective: Identify conserved residues in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro across variants to determine robust drug targets.
I carried out sequence analysis by running Blastp of 3C-like proteinase [Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus against the following search set: database [Non redundant protein sequences nr], organism- SARS-CoV-2 (taxid:2697049). I proceeded to run Multiple sequence alignment in Clustal Omega and visualized in jalview

Conserved Regions
1. Catalytic Dyad: Cys145-His41. The catalytic dyad is essential for proteolytic activity. Cys145 acts as a nucleophile, while His41 stabilizes the reaction intermediate.
2. S1 Subsite: Key residues: His163 (hydrogen bonding with Gln), Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143.
3. S2 Subsite: Key residues: His41, Met49, Met165.
4. S3 Subsites: Key residues: Glu166, Pro168, Gln189.

Implications for Drug Design
1. Conserved regions (S1/S2) are prime targets for broad-spectrum inhibitors.
2. Covalent inhibitors (e.g., Nirmatrelvir) exploit Cys145 reactivity for potency.



ðŸŽ¯ Step 2: Ligand Identification and ADMET Prediction
Objective: Evaluate the binding mechanism and pharmacokinetics of Nirmatrelvir.
So far, Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is the most successful Mpro inhibitor, with an unprecedentedly short period of 22 months (March 2020 to December 2021) between drug discovery and market authorization. Therefore, I investigated the drug action and binding mechanism of Nirmatrelvir. It works as a peptidomimetic inhibitor targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which is essential for viral replication.

Mechanism of Action
1. Target: Nirmatrelvir binds to the active site of Mpro, specifically interacting with the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys145) in the proteaseâ€™s active site. 
Inhibition: It forms a reversible covalent bond with Cys145, blocking the proteaseâ€™s ability to cleave viral polyproteins into functional units required for virus replication.
2. Effect: By inhibiting Mpro, Nirmatrelvir prevents the virus from processing polyproteins 1a and 1ab, halting production of nonstructural proteins essential for viral replication.
Role of Ritonavir as a co-drug
3. Nirmatrelvir is co-administered with ritonavir, which inhibits CYP3A4 enzymes that metabolize Nirmatrelvir, thereby increasing its plasma concentration and half-life.

Structural Insights
The inhibitor fits into the substrate-binding pocket of Mpro, interacting with key residues such as His41 and Glu166, stabilizing binding and blocking enzymatic activity.




ðŸŽ¯ Step 3: Molecular Docking and Visualization

Procedure
1. Protein (6LU7) and ligand (CID: 155903259) structures were obtained from PDB and PubChem respectively.
2. Docking was performed using SwissDock (default settings)
3. Visualization of docking poses was conducted using PyMOL and ChimeraX.
 
Docking Procedure in PyMOL
- Ligand sites identification
- Polar contacts to any atom
- â€˜Show sticks, byres protein within 5 Angstroms of drugâ€™ to locate binding sites
- Measurements to calculate binding distances

Key Observations
1. Binding pocket: Cys145-His41 catalytic dyad.
2. Outcome: Docking identified Nirmatrelvir as a potent inhibitor of viral replication.
