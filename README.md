Comprehensive Structural and Functional Insights into SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (Mpro) and its Inhibition by Nirmatrelvir: Sequence Conservation, Binding Mechanism, and Drug Efficacy Assessment.

A step-by-step guide covering the disease biology, key genes, drug discovery, and protein docking simulation to analyze approved drug- Nirmatrelvir.

ðŸŽ¯ Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) is a critical enzyme for viral replication, making it a prime target for antiviral drug development. This mini research project integrates bioinformatics tools to characterize Mproâ€™s active sites, conserved regions, and inhibition by Nirmatrelvir, Mpro inhibitor. Sequence analysis revealed universal conservation of the catalytic dyad (Cys145-His41) and substrate-binding subsites across coronaviruses. Molecular docking demonstrated nirmatrelvirâ€™s reversible covalent binding to Cys145, supported by interactions with key residues (His41, Glu166). ADMET predictions highlighted favorable pharmacokinetics but noted moderate CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and cardiac safety considerations. These findings provide mechanistic insights into Mproâ€™s role in COVID-19 and validate nirmatrelvirâ€™s binding mode, emphasizing conserved regions as targets for broad-spectrum antivirals. The project highlights critical residues for substrate recognition and catalysis, investigates ADMET properties of Nirmatrelvir, and discusses structural factors contributing to its high binding affinity.

To evaluate the coserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 main protease MPro and assess the evolutionary robustness of its inhibitor binding site, I performed a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using representative sequences from various SARS-CoV-2 lineages and related coronaviruses. The resulting alignment revealed a high degree of sequence conservation, particularly within the catalytic core and substrate-binding regions. Critical residues involved in Nirmatrelvir binding, including His41, Cys145, Glu166, and Met165, were strictly conserved across all sequences analyzed. This strong conservation suggests that Mpro maintains a structurally constrained active site, making it an ideal target for antiviral drug development. Fasta Files attached in results
