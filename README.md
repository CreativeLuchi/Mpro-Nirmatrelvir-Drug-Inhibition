# Mpro-Nirmatrelvir-Drug-Inhibition
Comprehensive Structural and Functional Insights into SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (Mpro) and its Inhibition by Nirmatrelvir: Sequence Conservation, Binding Mechanism, and Drug Efficacy Assessment.

A step-by-step guide covering the disease biology, key genes, drug discovery, and protein docking simulation to analyze approved drug- Nirmatrelvir.

ðŸŽ¯ Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) is a critical enzyme for viral replication, making it a prime target for antiviral drug development. This mini research project integrates bioinformatics tools to characterize Mproâ€™s active sites, conserved regions, and inhibition by Nirmatrelvir, Mpro inhibitor. Sequence analysis revealed universal conservation of the catalytic dyad (Cys145-His41) and substrate-binding subsites across coronaviruses. Molecular docking demonstrated nirmatrelvirâ€™s reversible covalent binding to Cys145, supported by interactions with key residues (His41, Glu166). ADMET predictions highlighted favorable pharmacokinetics but noted moderate CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and cardiac safety considerations. These findings provide mechanistic insights into Mproâ€™s role in COVID-19 and validate nirmatrelvirâ€™s binding mode, emphasizing conserved regions as targets for broad-spectrum antivirals. The project highlights critical residues for substrate recognition and catalysis, investigates ADMET properties of Nirmatrelvir, and discusses structural factors contributing to its high binding affinity.
