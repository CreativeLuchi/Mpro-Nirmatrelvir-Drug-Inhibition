ðŸŽ¯ Discussion
Nirmatrelvirâ€™s peptidomimetic design mimics the natural substrate, enabling selective inhibition of Mpro. Its covalent binding to Cys145 disrupts the catalytic dyad, while interactions with conserved subsites (S1/S2) explain broad-spectrum potential against coronaviruses. ADMET predictions align with clinical data, where ritonavir co-administration mitigates rapid CYP3A4 metabolism.

Comparison with Literature:
1. Conserved Sites: Matches structural studies highlighting Cys145-His41 as immutable across variants.
2. Drug Resistance: E166V mutation reduces nirmatrelvir binding, underscoring the need for resilient inhibitors.


ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
This study validates Mproâ€™s conservation and nirmatrelvirâ€™s mechanism through integrated bioinformatics. Conserved regions (S1/S2) are ideal targets for pan-coronavirus inhibitors, while ADMET insights guide optimization of next-generation antivirals. Future work should explore molecular dynamics to assess binding stability under mutational pressure.
